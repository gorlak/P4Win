Enhancements for 97.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#4560 	
	Now runs p4diff as internal diff.  It is still possible to use
	the Perforce-Options menu command to define an external diff 
	application.

#4542

	Now possible to change connection settings.  p4port, p4user and
	p4client can be set from within p4win.  By default, settings persist
	only until p4win exits, but changes to connection settings can also
	be written to the registry, at the user's option.

#4452 

	Allow direct edit of files open in changes window.

#4446 

	Double click in depot window now opens client file in editor ONLY
	if that file is already checked out for edit.  Otherwise, it fetches the
	depot head-rev copy for read-only viewing.

#4424 

	Performance: Depot listing slightly faster, and open files
	listing update is 10-15 times faster.  

#4357 

	Performance:  Now uses 30% less memory.

#4351 

	Add optional display of file open action and change
	description to pending changes window.

#4303 

	Detect and appropriately sort depot listing from case-insensitive servers.

#4272 

	Server/Client info window made cut-pasteable - also
	includes OS version and service pack info.

#4269 

	Allow edit, delete, lock and unlock to operate on folders in 
	the depot window.

#4259 

	File history dialog now is sizeable, and the text 
	window has scrollbars as required when the window is sized smaller
	than the text control contents

#4258 

	File history revision list control now sorts bi-directional when column
	headers clicked.

#4249 

	Defined double click actions for list views.  Client and user views 
	run describe, and all other list views run edit when double clicked.

#4248 

	All list views now have bi-directional sort.  The job,
	branch and label views resort automatically when a new item is created,
	and scroll the new item into view.

#4243 

	Spec dialog upgrade: droplists for user jobviews and job status fields

#4126 

	Updated dialogs for add files.  The	dialog allows the target change 
	for added files to be altered, to support drag-drop from file mangler 
	(NT 3.51) or file-finder file adding.

#3927 

	Make window position and state, and splitter bar position persistent

#3871 

	Replace options dialog with a tabbed dialog, with a tab dedicated
	to file-app associations.  This is required to support the one-shot
	editing from the depot window.

#3848 

	Allow right drag of files from depot window to a pending change, 
	with a context menu appearing on the drop.  This allows delete 
	under a specific change.

#3844 

	File information dialog, accessible in depot window, to show all
	relevant file parameters, including a list of who has the file open or 
	locked.


#3685 

	At startup, check to see if a previous instance of p4win is running.  
	If so, allow user to reactivate previous instance or choose to continue 
	with a second instance that may have different port, client or user 
	parameters.

	Allow change edit, submit and jobfix when any item under the change is 
	selected.
