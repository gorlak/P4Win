Sorry for the delay in answering, but I reallly don't check
that adress anymore. Now I'm at rodimus@2kweb.com. As for the
cursors, have it. It's freeware, if I did not want it manipulated
I wouldn't have uploaded it. But it is very courteous on your
part to ask for permission. Have it, do what you want with it.
Alhough a link, or a brief mentioning of my name would be nice,
but not obligatory.

Hi,

I saw your running CD animated cursor on the net and like it.  Do you sell
animated cursors?  If so, I am wondering what your fee would be to provide
an animated cursor, based upon the running CD cursor?  I would want
unlimited rights to distribute the resulting .ani file.

Nick
